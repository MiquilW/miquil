A girl once bought me a journal to write down my thoughts and express my emotions in a healthy way. I seldom ever used the journal for its original purpose. It turned into a place for me to write math and pseudo-code for projects I was working on.

Once I had filled it cover to cover, I never bought another one.

It wasn't until recently when I was looking at [my friend's website](https://www.jetthays.com/) that I wanted to start writing again. He has a brilliant blog you should check out for philosophical and technological readings alike. I love the way that he elegantly mixes his mental and creative outlet with his interest in technology. I was inspired by it, which is now why this blog exists. It will allow me to not only healthily document what's on my mind and what I've been working on, but also inspire others to do the same.

So welcome to my website and inaugural blog entry.
